# PyBer_-Analysis
## Project Overview
The project is helping Pyber to organize the data and create the visulaizes to analysis the relationship between riders and drivers in different cities.
*Organize data steps:
1. Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Merge your DataFrames.
*Visulaize data steps:
1. Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
2. Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
The total number of rides for each city type.
The average fares for each city type.
The total number of drivers for each city type.
3. Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
The number of rides for each city type.
The fares for each city type.
The number of drivers for each city type.
4. Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
The percent of total fares.
The percent of total rides.
The percent of total drivers.
